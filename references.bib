abstract = {We propose an extension of the Finite State Machine framework in distributed systems, using input/output partial order automata (IOPOA). In this model, transitions can be executed non-atomically, reacting to asynchronous inputs on several ports, and producing asynchronous output on those ports. We develop the formal framework for distributed testing in this architecture and compare with the synchronous I/O automaton setting. The advantage of the compact modelling by IOPOA combines with low complexity : the number of tests required for concurrent input in our model is polynomial in the number of inputs.},

abstract = {Two decidable logical theories are presented, one complete for deterministic polynomial time, one complete for polynomial space. Both have natural proof systems. A lower space bound of n/log(n) is shown for the proof system for the PTIME complete theory and a lower length bound of 2cn/log(n) is shown for the proof system for the PSPACE complete theory.},
